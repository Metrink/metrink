                        The Metrink agent uses the <a href="/integrated/documentation/api">RESTful API</a> to send standard
                        CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics to Metrink. With the Metrink agent, you can easily add additional scripts to be run
                        and collect metrics. So expanding the metrics you collect has never been easier.

                        The Metrink Daemon is an <strong>agentless</strong> solution that is installed on a single host within
                        your data center. It utilizes standard technologies to gather metrics from any device in your infrastructure.
                        It is highly configurable, making it easy to record custom metrics.
                        The daemon is ideal for engineers who want to focus on administering their systems,
                        not administering their monitoring solution. For additional information, see the
                        <a href="/integrated/documentation/daemon">Metrink Daemon Documentation</a>.

                    <p>
                        An agent is a monitoring application that is installed on <em>all</em> servers within
                        your data center. Agents require administrators to deploy and maintain an additional piece of
                        software on their systems. This is a compatibility, configuration, and maintenance nightmare.

                        Metrics can be sent directly to Metrink's RESTful HTTP API from any application. This is most applicable to developers who
                        want to push application specific metrics directly from their code. By combining both application performance metrics
                        and device metrics, you can get the complete view of your infrastructure in a single graph. For additional information,
                        see the <a href="/integrated/documentation/api">API specification</a>.

                  After a few minutes of gathering metrics, you can begin <a wicket:id="graphingLink">graphing</a>! Metrink's <a href="/integrated/documentation/query-language">Query Language</a> provides a

                  All of the information for a query is contained in the URL, so by simply copy and pasting the URL others can see the same graph. You can also
